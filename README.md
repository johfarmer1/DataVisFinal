Repo for Data Visualizations final project

Things we need to do in approxiate order
- [] Select which district with bottons
- [] fade currently selected district somehow
- [] Show population or politcal leanings of all districts
  - [] have a switch to select if we want to see population or political leaning
- [] Start making summary graphs on the right side
  - [] Population of districts
  - [] Political leaning of each district
  - [] Overall election results of the state (compare to baseline)
- [] Have a clear all districts button
- [] HAve a mode where we instead show districts political leaning on the map
