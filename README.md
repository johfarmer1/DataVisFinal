Repo for Data Visualizations final project

Things we need to do in approxiate order
- [x] Select which district with bottons
- [x] fade currently selected district somehow
- [x] Show population or politcal leanings of all districts
  - [x] have a switch to select if we want to see population or political leaning
- [x] Start making summary graphs on the right side
  - [x] Population of districts
  - [x] Political leaning of each district
  - [ ] Overall election results of the state (compare to baseline)
- [x] Have a clear all districts button
- [x] HAve a mode where we instead show districts political leaning on the map
